# Pointcloud Base Image

This is a base image for cloud processing of pointclouds. 

It contains base packages to convert pointclouds, as well as base packages
to use machine learning on the point clouds. 

This box does nothing by itself and is just a base image. 

However, use at your own discretion.

## Building the image

`docker build -t processing-image .`
